Precompiled styles:

You may delete precompiled syle files style/style.pre.css for debugging reasons.
This will slow down TABR considerably when called the first time.
To run precompilation use php5 csscompile.php in this direcory or call it from a browser.

HOWTO CREATE YOUR OWN STYLE

1. make a directory <stylename> in the styles directory and
2. create a file copy default.css to <stylename>.css in this directory
3. create stylefiles in <stylename> and relink them from <stylename>.css

WARNING: DO NOT *NEVER EVER* make a copy of the whole default style folder and start modifying it.
PLEASE override (relink) only those files that you need to modify! 

4. set $CONFIG_STYLE to <stylename>
