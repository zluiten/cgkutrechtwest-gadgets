3.1 RELEASE (upgrade from 3.0.5)
===========

A major reconfiguration of the file structure took place.
The following config changes are mandatory:

IMPORTANT CHANGES in config.php:
    $db_* renamed to $CONFIG_DB_*;
    
IMPORTANT UPDATE from config.template.php:
    $TMP_INSTALLDIR, $CONFIG_TAB_SERVER_ROOT, $CONFIG_TAB_ROOT, $CONFIG_MAIN_PAGE, $CONFIG_LOGOUT_PAGE.
    Minor additions to DB.

Sorry for the inconvenience, but this needed to be done to make TABR an 
embeddable account manager for use in other web applications.

Precompilable js and css files are now possible (you have to do that manually).
Use php5 -f csscompile.php (in lib/js/) and ./precompile.sh (in styles/)
Warning: Hostmonster includes single precompiled stylesheets and embeds them automatically. 
This interferes with images in styles.

3.0.5 RELEASE and prior
=======================

WARNING: TAB 1.04e upgrades to 3.0 are not possible. They must be first upgraded 
to 2.0x with the 2.0x codebase 
(e.g. http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=172286&package_id=197021&release_id=454116). 

MAJOR CHANGE:
    After the upgrade all user accounts are linked to address records.
    Login names change to the email address of the user.

2.x to 3.x and later UPGRADE:
    THIS IS A MAJOR UPGRADE! Read carefully! 
    EVERY USER WITH DUPLICATE EMAIL WILL BE DELETED! EVEN ADMINS!
    This is because the new login name is the email.
    Fix: Assign a different email to every user before the upgrade!

    1. Rename your old installation directory.
    2. Copy the new 3.0 codebase to the server.
    3. Copy your old mugshots directory to your new installation directory.
    4. CREATE a new config.php: Copy config.php.template to config.php on your 
       server and transfer the DB passwords from your old config to the new one 
       and change any new options you need.
    5. Run upgrade.php (after having a backup of your DB!!)

FUTURE VERSIONS: 3.0 to any newer or newer use the following
	1. copy the files to your server
	   (or use your deploy-config and ./deploy -t OR -q -- see INSTALL)
	2. Open in your browser: upgrade.php
	3. compare and edit config.php and config.php.template to check for new 
       options and
