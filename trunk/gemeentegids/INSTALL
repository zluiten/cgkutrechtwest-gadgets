Option 0:
    Use phpMyAdmin to upload extras/tab3.3_blank_db.sql.gz

Option 1:
1. Copy all files to server
2. Copy config.php.template to config.php on your server
   [Optional: change DB user, password, table prefix etc.]
2a. Plugins will load config.template.php by default. To customize plugins
    copy config.template.php to config.php and make changes for each plugin 
    in the plugin directory.
3. Grant access to the DB user for the database
	mysqladmin -u root -p create tab3
	mysql -u root -p -e 'GRANT ALL ON tab3.* TO tab3 IDENTIFIED BY "r3loaded"'
    DO NOT USE SPACES in passwords, prefixes, database names, tablenames! 
4. Open http://myserver.com/tab2/install.php in your browser and follow the instructions.

Option 2:
	This option speeds up future upgrades to a few minutes work if you have SSH 
    shell access to the server.

Requirements:
	You have SSH shell access to a server on a UNIX based system where you 
	want to install the system (See Using SSH authorized keys below).
	Recommended for Windows to Linux install: Cygwin installed (+ openssl package)	
	
Steps (The DB specified in deploy-config (MYSQL_DB_NAME) will be OVERWRITTEN):
1. cp deploy-config.template to deploy-config
2. Edit deploy-config (set install paths and hostnames)
3. Run ./deploy.sh -t (install testserver) or ./deploy.sh -q (install HOT server)
4. copy install.php to your server
5. Continue @ Option 1 Step 2

UPGRADE:
========

WARNING: 
    2.0->3.0 EVERY USER WITH DUPLICATE EMAIL WILL BE DELETED! EVEN ADMINS!
    Fix: Assign a different email to every user before the upgrade!

Please read the release notes at the download page at sourceforge NOW!
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=172286
Click the notes icon. It may contain up to date info on the release.

BACKUP FIRST or be sorry:
	Make a backup of your DB and your old version of TAB !!!!!
	mysqldump -u root -p TABDATABASENAME >myTABBackup.sql
    ... or use phpmyadmin.

WARNING: TAB 1.04e upgrades to 3.0 are not possible. They must be first upgraded 
to 2.0x with the 2.0x codebase 
(e.g. http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=172286&package_id=197021&release_id=454116). 

MAJOR CHANGE:
    After the upgrade all user accounts are linked to address records.
    Login names change to the email address of the user.

2.x to 3.x and later UPGRADE:
    THIS IS A MAJOR UPGRADE! Read carefully! 
    EVERY USER WITH DUPLICATE EMAIL WILL BE DELETED! EVEN ADMINS!
    This is because the new login name is the email.
    Fix: Assign a different email to every user before the upgrade!

    1. Rename your old installation directory.
    2. Copy the new 3.0 codebase to the server.
    3. Copy your old mugshots directory to your new installation directory.
    4. CREATE a new config.php: Copy config.php.template to config.php on your 
       server and transfer the DB passwords from your old config to the new one 
       and change any new options you need.
    5. Run upgrade.php (after having a backup of your DB!!)

FUTURE VERSIONS: 3.0 to any newer or newer use the following
	1. copy the files to your server
	   (or use your deploy-config and ./deploy -t OR -q -- see INSTALL)
	2. Open in your browser: upgrade.php
	3. compare and edit config.php and config.php.template to check for new 
       options and

HINTS:
======

Using SSH authorized keys:
--------------------------
Generate an ssh paswordless login identity:
localhost#> ssh-keygen -t rsa
Do not enter a password if you want a passwordless login.
Install the identity on the remote host account of user@remote.com:
localhost#> cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh user@remote.com 'cat>>.ssh/authorized_keys'
You can also copy the content of id_rsa.pub manually with an editor to .ssh/authorized_keys
.ssh/authorized_keys needs to be created

Hostmonster hosting:
--------------------

The following issue occurs with hostmonster accounts (Apache 1.37):

Scripts show once or twice the following message. 
After that they work like normal until changed or uploaded again.

<!-- SHTML Wrapper - 500 Server Error -->
[an error occurred while processing this directive]

Resolution:
The custom Apacher server at hostmonster detects wrong file permissions and corrects them (one by one!!!).
Watch how the file changes permissions from -rw-rw-r-- to -rw-r--r-- after you access the file.

So ... when uploading with ssh make sure you change permission to 644 if you see that error!
